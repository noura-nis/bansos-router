# bansos-router: Upstreams, Catalog & Relay

> Companion to `architecture.md`. Details the keyless free upstreams, the
> curated model catalog, health checking, rate-limit handling, and the relay
> egress design (patterns carried over from `pi-bansos`; local-gateway
> chaining and ban-risk hygiene informed by `freebuff-proxy`).

## 1. Design goals for the upstream layer

- **Keyless first**: flagship upstreams need zero credentials.
- **Curated catalog**: we advertise only models we registered and verified;
  never pass through an upstream's full model list (avoids leaking paid
  models into `/v1/models`).
- **Liveness-gated**: free promos expire; dead models are skipped silently.
- **Relay escape hatch**: per-IP rate limits are dodged by routing egress
  through a user-owned relay, toggled live, no daemon restart.
- **Upstream taxonomy**: two kinds:
  - *remote keyless* (Zen, Kilo, LLM7): zero credentials; spoofed headers
    where needed; relay egress allowed.
  - *local token gateways* (freebuff-proxy, LiteLLM, 9router, ollama):
    **roadmap (M5)**: opt-in, chained at `127.0.0.1:<port>`; may carry a
    token; relay egress **off**.

### 1.1 Dynamic catalog & hardcoded fallback

Catalog bansos-router bersifat **live-first dengan pinned fallback**:

- **Kilo & LLM7** secara periodik (default tiap 30 menit,
  `refreshIntervalMs` di `~/.bansos/config.json`) memanggil endpoint
  `/models` upstream dan menyaring model gratis:
  - Kilo: filter `id` diakhiri `:free` ditambah ID dari pinned list.
  - LLM7: filter `usage_based_only === false` atau `tier === "turbo"`.
- Saat endpoint upstream gagal / timeout / mengembalikan array kosong,
  daemon otomatis mempertahankan model hasil `seed()` (pinned hardcoded)
  sehingga katalog tidak kosong.
- Ketiga upstream diquery **paralel** dalam satu pass, jadi satu gateway lambat
  hanya memakan latensinya sendiri, bukan dijumlahkan.
- **Zen memakai models.dev sebagai sumber metadata**: endpoint `/models`
  mereka hanya mengembalikan `{id, object, created, owned_by}` tanpa satu pun
  field yang dibutuhkan `ModelDef`, dan tanpa penanda gratis/berbayar
  (`created` pun palsu: di-stamp per request). Jadi katalog dibangun dari
  irisan models.dev dengan listing Zen; seed lokal tinggal jadi sumber
  `wireApi`, fallback field yang tidak dipublikasikan index, dan daftar id yang
  diprobe. Model free baru ikut otomatis. Lihat §4.2.

## 2. Upstreams (v1)

### 2.1 OpenCode Zen

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1` (OpenAI-compatible) |
| Auth | Keyless passthrough (no login) |
| Spoofed headers | `User-Agent: opencode/latest/2.0.5/cli`, `authorization: Bearer public`, `x-opencode-client: cli`, `x-opencode-project: <hex40>`, `x-opencode-session: ses_<descending_id>`, `x-session-affinity: <session>`, `x-session-id: <session>`, `b3`, `traceparent` |
| Model source | **Pinned seed** (`src/upstreams/zen.ts`) intersected with live `GET /v1/models`; seeded ids missing from the live list are probed once and dropped if they fail. Live ids outside the seed are never added, so the catalog cannot leak paid models |
| Rate limit | Unpublished; treated as best-effort |
| Gateway quirk | The free-tier gate requires `stream: true` and the presence of core tools (`read` + `shell`). The router injects them when the caller declared none, folds the forced stream back to JSON for non-streaming callers (both wires), and strips tool calls aimed at the injected tools. See §2.1.1 |

#### 2.1.1 Consequences of the injected tools

The gate forces two things on every Zen request, and each one has to be undone
before the caller sees the answer.

**`stream: true`.** Zen answers in SSE even when the caller asked for JSON. The
chat wire folds those frames back with `streamToChatResponse`. The responses
wire needs two hops: responses SSE to chat SSE first (`toChatResponse`), then
the same fold. Handing `toChatResponse` an SSE body while asking it for JSON
makes it fail its `JSON.parse` and pass raw SSE to the caller.

**`read` + `shell` tool definitions.** The model does call them. Two guards:

- On the **chat wire** the injected tools carry `tool_choice: "none"`, so they
  are advertised but never used.
- On the **responses wire** that is impossible: it answers
  `400 only "auto" is supported for tool_choice`. The model there can and does
  call our tools, so the cleanup happens on the response instead —
  `streamToChatResponse` takes the set of tool names the caller actually
  declared and drops any call outside it, demoting `finish_reason` from
  `tool_calls` back to `stop` when nothing survives.

Streaming callers are covered by `filterInjectedToolCallsTransform`, which sits
at the head of the outbound SSE pipeline and therefore serves both wires (the
responses wire reaches it already translated to chat SSE). A tool name arrives
in the first delta for its index, so the verdict is taken there and reused for
the argument deltas that follow; an index whose name is never seen is let
through, so a malformed stream loses nothing. Frames it does not change are
forwarded byte-for-byte.

> ⚠️ ToS note: OpenCode Zen's free tier is intended for OpenCode users. The
> passthrough pattern (already used by pi-bansos, 9router, zen-proxy) is
> tolerated today but can change. Health-check + relay keep the router
> resilient if a model or the whole endpoint disappears.

### 2.2 KiloCode gateway

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway/chat/completions` |
| Auth | Keyless: 200 requests/hour per IP |
| Model source | `GET https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway/models` (filter `:free` suffix / known ids) |
| Quirk | Free models reject `reasoning_effort`; some emit output in `reasoning` field |

### 2.3 LLM7

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `https://api.llm7.io/v1` (OpenAI-compatible) |
| Auth | **Anonymous**: send `api_key: "unused"`; optional free token from `dash.llm7.io` for higher limits |
| Model source | `GET /v1/models`: **dynamic** (filtered by `usage_based_only: false`); stable selectors: `default`, `fast` (pro is paid-only) |
| Rate limit | Shared anonymous tier (1 request concurrency per IP); free token raises limits |
| Quirk | Models can appear/disappear: dynamic catalog + health-check are mandatory |

> LLM7 models are dynamically snapshot via `GET /v1/models`. Only models with
> `usage_based_only: false` (tier turbo) are registered as free models. The
> pro tier models (paid per token) are automatically excluded.

### 2.4 Future (roadmap: out of v1 scope)

v1 ships **keyless upstreams only**. These land later:

- **FreeBuff: via `freebuff-proxy` (token-based local gateway)**. `freebuff-proxy`
  (Go, MIT) exposes FreeBuff/Codebuff CLI models through OpenAI, Anthropic, and
  Responses wires at `http://127.0.0.1:3457/v1`. Chaining it as a *local
  upstream* is designed but deferred: it needs a `cb_...` token, has **high
  ban risk** (ToS conflict), and requires relay egress **off** (its own docs
  warn against VPN/hosting egress). Design rules are captured in
  `docs/architecture.md` §7.7 + this section's history; implementation lands
  with `{ type: "local-openai", baseUrl, apiKey? }` in `~/.bansos/config.json`.
- **OpenRouter `:free`** models (20 req/min, 200 req/day per model: needs no
  key for some models, else optional key)
- **Routeway `:free`**, **OVHcloud AI Endpoints anonymous tier** (2 req/min/IP,
  no signup), DashScope free tokens
- Each new upstream must declare: base URL, auth mode, catalog source, rate
  limits, and `compat` flags (see `docs/protocols.md` §5).

## 3. Catalog format

Static registry shipped in code, one seed array per upstream
(`src/upstreams/zen.ts`, `kilo.ts`, `llm7.ts`), one entry per known free model. Exception: sources with **dynamic catalogs** (LLM7) are
snapshotted into the runtime catalog at health-check time instead of being
pinned statically. The **runtime catalog** is the union of the static
registry and dynamic snapshots, filtered by liveness; only the runtime
catalog is served.

```ts
type ModelDef = {
  id: string;            // exact upstream model id (never an alias)
  name: string;
  source: "zen" | "kilo" | "llm7" | "local";
  reasoning: boolean;
  contextWindow: number;
  maxTokens: number;
  input: ("text" | "image")[];
  compat: {
    supportsReasoningEffort: boolean;
    supportsDeveloperRole: boolean;
    thinkingFormat?: "content" | "reasoning-field";
  };
  cost: { input: 0; output: 0; cacheRead: 0; cacheWrite: 0 };
  wireApi?: "chat" | "responses";  // upstream wire format; defaults to chat
};
```

`wireApi: "responses"` marks a model the upstream only serves on
`/v1/responses`. The forward path swaps in `Upstream.responsesUrl`, translates
the outbound chat body with `chatToResponsesBody()`, and converts the reply back
with `responsesToChatJson()` (or `responsesToChatStream()` for SSE), all in
`src/protocols/responses-upstream.ts`. Everything downstream — the chat,
Responses, and Anthropic handlers, usage logging, the reasoning fold — keeps
seeing OpenAI chat and needs no per-model branching.

v1 seed (pinned seeds + live refresh; liveness drops dead ids, live `:free`
ids from the kilo API join at runtime):

**OpenCode Zen (7 seeded):** `mimo-v2.5-free`, `nemotron-3-ultra-free`,
`big-pickle`, `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`, `ling-3.0-flash-fin-free`,
`muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free`, `muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free` (the two
Muse ids are `wireApi: "responses"`)

**KiloCode gateway (17 seeded):** `kilo-auto/free`, `stepfun/step-3.7-flash:free`,
`nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free`,
`nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning:free`, `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-content-safety:free`,
`liquid/lfm-2.5-2.6b:free`, `poolside/laguna-s-2.1:free`, `cohere/north-mini-code:free`,
`poolside/laguna-xs-2.1:free`, `nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-omni-30b-a3b-reasoning:free`,
`inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash-sante:free`, `inclusionai/ling-3.0-flash-fin:free`,
`dots-studio/dots-3-note-preview:free`,
`thinkingmachines/inkling:free`, `thinkingmachines/inkling-small:free`, `openrouter/free`

**LLM7 (5 seeded + dynamic refresh):** `codestral-latest`, `minimax-m2.7`,
`mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407`, `default`, `fast`. Live models are filtered by
`usage_based_only: false` (tier turbo); the retired `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` /
`gpt-oss:20b` ids and the paid-only `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` were dropped.

## 4. Health checking

| Phase | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| Startup | daemon boot | fetch each upstream catalog; mark alive/dead; log `✓/✗` per model |
| Periodic | every `refreshInterval` (default 30 min, configurable) | re-fetch; update runtime catalog in place; keep serving during the check |
| Manual | `bansos refresh` | force a check now |
| Failure policy | upstream unreachable | keep last-known-good catalog; mark source `degraded`; do not wipe models (a blip ≠ death) |

Catalog fetches are cheap (`GET /v1/models`-style). For kilo and llm7 the
listing itself is authoritative, so liveness of **individual** models is
derived from the upstream catalog containing that id. Zen's listing is not
exhaustive (some servable promos are never listed), so zen re-checks each
seed against the listing and only probe-verifies the unlisted ones keyless
(typically zero to one model per refresh).

### 4.2 Building the Zen catalog

Kilo and LLM7 can auto-add a model they have never seen because their listings
carry everything `ModelDef` needs. Zen's listing carries an id and nothing else,
so `fetchCatalog()` assembles a model from two live sources:

1. **models.dev** for the free/paid signal (`cost.input === 0`), retirement
   (`status`), and the facts about the model itself: name, reasoning, context,
   output limit, modalities. Values are used as published; a field the index
   omits falls back to the matching `ZEN_MODELS` entry before the generic
   default, so a dropped `limit` cannot silently shrink a known model to 128k.
2. **Zen's live `/v1/models`** to confirm the gateway actually offers the id.

`wireApi` is the only field neither source carries, and it is read off the
matching `ZEN_MODELS` entry. Everything else about a model now comes from the
index, so there is no override table to keep in sync.

Two global rules still apply, because they are about this router rather than
about any one model:

- Modalities are filtered per wire. `ZEN_RESPONSES_MODALITIES` allows text,
  image and pdf; `ZEN_CHAT_MODALITIES` allows text and image, because Zen
  answers 500 for a `file` part on `/chat/completions` while carrying the same
  PDF fine on `/responses`. A model the seed does not know defaults to the chat
  set. Audio is in neither: both models advertising it discard it on the wire
  (§3.4 of `protocols.md`).
- `supportsReasoningEffort` is always `false`, never derived. `pickFailover`
  only pairs models whose flag matches and every model in the catalog is
  `false`, so a single derived `true` would leave that model with no failover
  at all.

#### Retirement and liveness

A seeded model the index marks `deprecated` **or paid** is **probed** rather
than trusted, even while Zen still lists it. Both verdicts mean the same thing
for a keyless router: being listed no longer implies being servable. That is the difference between MiMo V2.5, which
is retired and still answering, and DeepSeek V4 Flash Free, which was listed for
days after it began returning 400. Alive keeps it; dead drops it.

A seeded id missing from the listing is probed too, since the listing is not
exhaustive. When models.dev is unreachable the seed alone drives the pass —
unreachable covers a rejected fetch (DNS failure, refused connection, timeout)
as well as a non-ok status, so an index outage degrades the pass instead of
wiping Zen out of the catalog. When the Zen listing is unreachable the catalog
keeps its last-known models.

#### Failover tolerance

`pickFailover` used to require a candidate's context to be greater than or equal
to the origin's, which made Muse's published 1_048_576 unusable: it pushed
Nemotron 3 Ultra's 1_000_000 out of the failover set over a 4.6% gap. The rule
now admits anything within `FAILOVER_CONTEXT_TOLERANCE` (90%), so the published
figure can be used as-is.

Ranking is asymmetric, because the two directions are not equally safe. A
candidate at or above the origin's context can serve every request the origin
could; one inside the 90% band cannot, and a near-full-context request that
lands there fails with a context-length 400. So candidates that cover the origin
are preferred as a group, ranked among themselves by the smallest surplus, and
the band is only reached for when nothing covers it. `maxTokens` breaks a tie,
larger winning.

## 5. Rate limiting (daemon-local)

- Per-IP sliding window on inbound requests (default: generous, e.g. 300/min)
 : protects the loopback socket if the user binds LAN, not a real abuse
  defense for public exposure (which we don't support).
- Configurable via `~/.bansos/config.json`; disabled entirely with
  `BANSOS_RATE_LIMIT=0`.

## 6. Upstream rate-limit reality

| Upstream | Limit | Shared across harnesses? |
|---|---|---|
| KiloCode | 200 req/hr/IP | ✅ yes: all harnesses share your IP |
| OpenCode Zen | unpublished | ✅ likely |
| OpenRouter free | 20 req/min, 200 req/day/model | ✅ yes |

**Consequence:** running 5 harnesses through one daemon shares one budget.
This is the core argument for the relay feature (§8).

## 7. Relay egress

### 7.1 Pattern (proven in pi-bansos / 9router)

When enabled, upstream requests are sent **to the relay URL** with two
headers; the relay forwards to the real upstream and streams the body back
unchanged (SSE passes through untouched):

```
POST https://<relay>/            ← relay URL
x-relay-target: https://api.kilo.ai   ← upstream origin (allowlisted)
x-relay-path:   /api/gateway/chat/completions
```

- Relay is a trivial server: read `x-relay-target` + `x-relay-path`, validate
  against an allowlist, forward method/headers/body, stream back.
- **Allowlist:** `ALLOWED_TARGETS` = known upstream origins only
  (`opencode.ai`, `api.kilo.ai`, `llm7.io`, ...). Relay cannot be abused as an
  open proxy to arbitrary hosts.
- **Local gateways bypass the relay (M5)**: chained local upstreams
  (freebuff-proxy at `127.0.0.1:3457`, LiteLLM, 9router, ollama) will always
  be reached directly. For FreeBuff this is mandatory: relaying would route
  through a hosting egress IP and trigger upstream abuse scoring.
- Fallback: if the relay itself errors (unreachable, timeout, 5xx), egress
  silently falls back to direct so requests keep working. There is **no
  strict relay-only mode yet**; when the relay is flaky, traffic may leave
  from your real IP without a warning.

### 7.2 Relay types

| Type | Deploy | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Vercel worker | `bansos relay deploy`, **stub (M4, belum berfungsi)**; bring-your-own URL dulu | free tier: 100 GB / 500k invocations/mo |
| Cloudflare worker | manual URL via `bansos relay url <URL>` | free tier generous |
| Deno / user-owned | manual URL | any |

### 7.3 State & UX

- Saved relays list + active relay + enabled flag persist in
  `~/.bansos/relay-state.json` (outside package dir, survives npm updates).
- Live toggling: `bansos relay on|off|use <URL>|list|remove <URL>|deploy`.
- **No built-in default relay**: a public package must never bake in one
  user's personal relay URL.
- A relay is a single fixed exit IP (no rotation): multiple relays can be
  saved and switched; auto-rotation across saved relays is a v1.1 candidate.
- **Probe (reachability check) is SSRF-limited**: `/bansos/relay/probe` may
  only target the active relay, a *saved* relay, or a public `https://` host.
  Literal loopback/private/link-local IPs (mis. `127.0.0.1`,
  `169.254.x`/metadata, `192.168.x`) are rejected with 403 unless the URL is
  explicitly saved as a relay.
- **Relay URLs are validated on write**: only `http(s)://` without embedded
  credentials and with a bounded length; payloads with unknown fields are
  sanitized. Invalid payloads get HTTP 400 and leave state untouched.

## 8. Failure taxonomy & handling

| Condition | Symptom | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| Model removed upstream | missing from catalog fetch | dropped at next health pass |
| Model promo expired (id 404s) | upstream 404/400 on request | returned as error; dropped on next refresh |
| Per-IP rate limit hit | upstream 429/402 | error surfaced (mapped per protocol); `bansos relay on` is the fix |
| Whole upstream down | connect timeout | mark source degraded, keep last-known catalog, log |
| Relay down | relay 5xx/timeout | silent direct fallback (keep working); `bansos relay off` untuk mematikan egress relay |

## 9. ToS & ethical guardrails (ship in README)

- Free tiers are **best-effort**: promos expire, IDs change, limits move.
- Don't hammer upstreams: the health check is the only automated traffic
  beyond actual usage.
- Relay usage must respect the upstream's ToS; the tool is for personal
  development use.
- **FreeBuff (M5) is opt-in with real ban risk**: requires a FreeBuff/Codebuff
  account token; using it conflicts with FreeBuff ToS and upstream detection
  can suspend accounts. Default off, residential IP only, modest usage, and
  never routed through the relay.
- bansos-router does not resell, pool, or proxy access for third parties.
